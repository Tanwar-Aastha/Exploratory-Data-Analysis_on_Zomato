# Exploratory-Data-Analysis_on_Zomato

## Observations and Recommendations
1. The dataset is skewed towards India and doesnâ€™t represent the complete data of restaurants worldwide.
2. There is no relation between cost and rating. Some of the best-rated restaurants are low on cost and vice versa.
3. Most of the restaurants are in India, to be precise 93.2%, this is understandable since Zomato is an Indian Company.
4. Not rated count is very high, this may happen mainly because customers do not like to review after having their food. This is why Zomato asks the users to rate the restaurants after around 1 hour of food delivery. This may prompt the customers to appreciate the food they had. If they had to criticise, they would have done it already.
5. Clearly, among all the restaurants, orange rated(average)(2.5-3.4) is the most common frequent rating.
6. The highest number of ratings recieved is around 3.0 to 3.8, this may happen because the number of restaurants which have high rating is low in number. India has the most number of restaurants and many restaurants fall into the bucket of 3 to 4 rating range.
7. 87% of restaurants are there having excellent rating but are not offering online deliveries. There could be a number of reasons for this, like the restaurant being extremely large or tiny enough that they do not have a sufficient profit margin when selling through Zomato.
8. The maximum number of restaurants falls in the 0 - 1000 price range and 2.5 to 4.0 rating.
9. Delhi has a lot of restaurants listed on Zomato. Connaught place has over 120 restaurants listed.
